## Naming Conventions

For *all* coding please stick to the following conventions, or I get fucking eye cancer:

- **Variables** of any type are named using **underscores**, e.g. my_variable
- **Functions and Methods** are named using **CamelCase** notation, first letter lower-case, e.g. readFile()
- **Classes** are also named using **CamelCase** but with an upper-case first letter, e.g. RoadWithAwesomeTrees
	
Also, I hate people doing this:

	public function foo()
	{
		*something*
	}
	
And really prefer this

	public function foo() {
		*something*
	}
	
but I guess thats up to you.
